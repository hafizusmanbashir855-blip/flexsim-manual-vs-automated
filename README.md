# FlexSim Project: Manual vs Automated Simulation

## Overview
Comparison of manual vs automated material handling systems using FlexSim.

## Files Included
- Word report (Manual vs Automated FlexSim Project.docx)
- PDF version (Manual vs Automated FlexSim Project.pdf)
- Simulation screenshots

## Results
- Manual system (1 operator) → Output = 30
- Manual system (4 operators + dispatcher) → Output = 480
- Automated system (Elevator + AGVs) → Output = 604

## Conclusion
Automation improved throughput, reduced idle time, and enhanced worker safety & environment.
